## Fee Token Caveat

**Note:** The contract and scripts assume that the Hyperbridge fee token (e.g., USD.h) is always available in sufficient quantity and approved for use by the contract. In production, you must ensure the contract has enough fee tokens and the correct approval for the dispatcher contract, or Hyperbridge requests will fail.
