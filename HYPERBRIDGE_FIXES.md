# Hyperbridge Integration Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing StateMachine Import**
**Issue**: The contract was trying to import `StateMachine.sol` from the wrong path.
**Fix**: Updated import to use the correct path: `@polytope-labs/ismp-solidity/interfaces/StateMachine.sol`

### 2. **Incorrect DispatchGet Structure**
**Issue**: The `requestPriceGet` function was using the wrong number of fields for `DispatchGet` struct.
**Fix**: Removed the incorrect `sender` field and used the correct 6-field structure:
- `dest`: Destination state machine
- `height`: Block height to read from
- `keys`: Storage keys to read
- `timeout`: Request timeout
- `fee`: Protocol fee
- `context`: Application-specific metadata


### 5. **Improved Response Handling**
**Issue**: The manual resolve script wasn't properly mocking the Hyperbridge response format.
**Fix**: Updated `scripts/manualResolve.js` to:
- Use proper key encoding for Chainlink price feeds
- Mock the correct response structure
- Handle the proper storage value format

## New Scripts Created

### `scripts/requestPrice.js`
- Handles fee token setup and approval
- Requests price from Hyperbridge with proper parameters
- Includes error handling and balance checks

### `scripts/testHyperbridgeFlow.js`
- Comprehensive test of the full Hyperbridge integration flow
- Creates market, submits prediction, closes market, requests price, and resolves
- Demonstrates the complete end-to-end process
